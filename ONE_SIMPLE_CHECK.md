# ✅ One Simple Check

## What I Fixed

1. ✅ Deprecated `response.text()` → now uses `getText()`
2. ✅ Fixed build script
3. ✅ Fixed railway.json

---

## ONE Thing to Check

**Go to Railway dashboard:**
1. Click "web" service
2. Click "Deployments" tab
3. Look at the **top deployment** (most recent)
4. **Is it green or red?**

**That's it. Just tell me: green or red?**

---

## If Green

✅ Build succeeded! Try creating a clinical note.

---

## If Red

❌ Build failed. Click on it and tell me what the error says (or take a screenshot).

**Just one check: green or red?** 🚦
