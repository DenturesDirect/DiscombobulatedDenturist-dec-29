# ⚠️ Nixpacks Deprecated - What Railway Wants Now

## The Problem

**Nixpacks is deprecated** - Railway has changed their build system.

---

## What Railway Wants Now

**Railway likely wants:**
1. **Dockerfile** (proper one, not auto-detected)
2. **Or a different build method**

---

## Option 1: Create a Proper Dockerfile

If Railway wants Dockerfile, let's create a proper one:

**I can create a Dockerfile that:**
- Uses Node.js
- Installs dependencies
- Builds the app
- Runs the server

---

## Option 2: Check Railway's Current Build Options

**In Railway Settings:**
1. **What build options do you see?**
2. **Is there a "Dockerfile" option?**
3. **Is there a new build method?**

---

## Quick Fix

**Tell me:**
- What build options does Railway show you?
- Does it want a Dockerfile?
- What's the recommended build method now?

**I'll create whatever Railway needs!**
