# 🎯 Identify Which Railway Project You're Using

## Both Look the Same

**Both have:**
- ✅ Web service
- ✅ Connected to GitHub

**So how do we tell them apart?**

## Quick Ways to Identify

### Method 1: Check the URL

1. **What's the URL of your app?** (the one you're actually using)
2. **It looks like:** `https://something.up.railway.app`
3. **Which Railway project does that URL belong to?**
4. **That's the one you're using!**

### Method 2: Check Recent Deployments

1. **Look at Deployments tab in BOTH projects**
2. **Which one has deployments from the last few minutes?** (from our recent pushes)
3. **That's the active one!**

### Method 3: Check Which One is "Online"

1. **Look at both projects**
2. **Which web service shows "Online" (green dot)?**
3. **Which one shows "Crashed" or something else?**
4. **The "Online" one is probably the one you're using**

## Tell Me

**What distinguishes the one you think you're using?**
- Different name?
- Different URL?
- More recent deployments?
- Something else?

**Or just tell me the Railway URL you're actually using, and I'll help you identify which project it belongs to!**
