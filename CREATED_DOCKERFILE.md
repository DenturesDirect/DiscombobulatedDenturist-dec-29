# ✅ Created Dockerfile

## The Solution

**Instead of fighting with Railway's build system, I created a proper Dockerfile.**

Railway will now use the Dockerfile instead of trying to auto-detect or use Nixpacks/Railpack.

---

## What I Created

✅ **Dockerfile** that:
- Uses Node.js 20
- Installs dependencies
- Builds the app
- Runs the server

---

## Railway Should Now

1. **Detect the Dockerfile automatically**
2. **Use it for building**
3. **No more Nixpacks/Railpack issues**

---

## After Railway Rebuilds

1. **Wait 2-3 minutes**
2. **Check Railway → Deployments**
3. **Should build successfully now!**

---

**Railway is rebuilding with the Dockerfile now. This should finally work!**
