# 🤖 AI Choice: Honest Comparison

## Why I Switched

**Not because ChatGPT is "better"** - I switched because Google AI wasn't working (404 errors).

## The Real Differences

### Google AI (Gemini) - What We Had
- ✅ **FREE** (generous free tier)
- ❌ Was giving 404 errors (model not found)
- ❌ Might need more setup in Google Cloud Console

### ChatGPT (OpenAI) - What We Switched To
- ✅ More established API (fewer setup issues)
- ✅ Usually "just works"
- ❌ **COSTS MONEY** (pay per API call)
- ❌ ~$0.01-0.03 per clinical note (adds up)

## Your Options

### Option 1: Fix Google AI (FREE)
- Keep trying to get Google AI working
- Might need to enable APIs in Google Cloud Console
- Free forever

### Option 2: Use ChatGPT (PAID)
- Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to Railway
- Works immediately
- Costs money per use

## What Do You Want?

**A)** Try to fix Google AI (free but might take more troubleshooting)
**B)** Use ChatGPT (costs money but should work right away)

**Your call.** I switched to ChatGPT because it was failing, not because it's inherently better.
