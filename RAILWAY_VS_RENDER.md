## 💡 Recommendation for YOUR Situation

**For staff testing and finding bugs:**

### Option 1: Railway (If you can add payment method)
- **Best choice** if you're okay adding a payment method

- You won't be charged if you stay within free tier limits
- Better for when staff are actively using it

### Option 2: Render (If you can't add payment method)
- **Best choice** if you can't/won't add payment method
- Still works great, just slower first load after sleep
- Perfect for testing and bug finding

## 🎯 My Recommendation

**Start with Railway if possible:**
- Add payment method (you won't be charged for free tier usage)
- Better experience for your staff
- Faster response times
- No sleeping issues

**Use Render if:**
- You can't add a payment method
- You want true free (no card on file)
- You're okay with slower first load after inactivity

## 🚀 Quick Decision Guide

**Choose Railway if:**
- ✅ You can add a payment method

**Choose Render if:**
- ✅ You can't add a payment method
- ✅ You want completely free (no card)

## 💰 Cost Reality

**Both are FREE for your use case:**
- Railway: Free tier (500 hours/month) - enough for testing
- Render: Free tier (750 hours/month) - enough for testing
- Neither will charge you if you stay within limits

**Railway just needs a payment method on file** (like a safety net, but you won't be charged for free tier usage).

   - Best if you can add payment method
   - Better for active use

2. **Render** = Easier to start, completely free
