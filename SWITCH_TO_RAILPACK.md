# ✅ Switch to Railpack (Nixpacks Deprecated)

## The Problem

**Nixpacks is deprecated!** Railway now uses **Railpack**.

---

## What I Just Did

✅ Changed `railway.json` to use `RAILPACK` instead of `NIXPACKS`
✅ Removed `nixpacks.toml` (not needed with Railpack)

---

## Also Check Railway Dashboard

**Make sure Railway Settings match:**

1. **Railway → web service → Settings**
2. **Build section → Select "Railpack"** (not Nixpacks, not Dockerfile)
3. **Save**

## Railway is Rebuilding

This should finally fix the Dockerfile parse error!

**Railpack is Railway's new build system - it should work much better.**

---

**Railway is rebuilding with Railpack now. This should work!**
