# 🔍 How to Identify Your Railway Project

## Your Project Name

Based on what we've seen, your project is likely called:
- **"protective-ambition"** (this is what we saw in Railway earlier)

---

## How to Check in Railway Dashboard

1. **Open Railway in your browser:**
   - Go to: https://railway.app/
   - Make sure you're logged in

2. **Look at the top left:**
   - You should see your project name
   - It's probably **"protective-ambition"** or similar

3. **Or look at the URL:**
   - The URL might be: `https://railway.app/project/[project-id]`
   - Or it might show the project name in the navigation

---

## When You Run `railway link`

You'll see a list like this:

```
? Select a project:
❯ protective-ambition
  another-project-name
  yet-another-project
```

**Select the one that matches what you see in Railway dashboard!**

## If You're Not Sure

**Option 1: Check Railway Dashboard First**
1. Open Railway in your browser
2. Look at the project name at the top
3. Remember it
4. Then run `railway link` and pick that one

**Option 2: Just Pick the First One**
- If you only have one project, it's probably the right one!
- Railway will show you all your projects

**Option 3: Look for the Project with Postgres**
- Your project should have:
  - A "web" service
  - A "Postgres" service
- If the list shows project details, pick the one with both services

## Quick Check

**Tell me:**
- What project name do you see in Railway dashboard (top left)?

I can help you pick the right one! 😊
