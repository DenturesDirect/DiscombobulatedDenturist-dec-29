# 🤷 Two Railway Projects - The Truth

## Is It Actually a Problem?

**Short answer: Not really.**

### What Actually Happens:
- ✅ Both projects can work fine
- ✅ Both deploy from the same GitHub repo
- ✅ Both can have their own databases
- ✅ Both can run independently

### The Only "Problem":
- 🤷 **Confusion** - Which one are you using?
- 🤷 **Waste** - Paying for two if both are on paid plans
- 🤷 **Variables** - Need to add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to the RIGHT one

---

## So What Should You Do?

### Option 1: Keep Both (Fine!)
- Just make sure you know which one you're using
- Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to the one you actually use
- Bookmark the URL of the one you use

### Option 2: Delete One (Cleaner)
- If you want less confusion
- But it's not REQUIRED

---

## The Real Question:

**Which Railway project are you actually USING?**
- That's the one you need to add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to
- That's the one you should bookmark
- The other one can just sit there (or you can delete it later)

---

**Bottom line:** It's not breaking anything. Just pick one to use and ignore the other (or delete it if you want).
