# 💳 Google AI Payment Method Requirement

## You Were Right!

**Google's Policy:**
- ✅ Even "free" tiers require a payment method on file
- ✅ This prevents abuse and allows auto-charging if you exceed limits
- ✅ Without a payment method, the API won't work (even if it's free)

**This was likely why Google AI wasn't working!**

## Current Situation

We've already switched to **ChatGPT/OpenAI** because:
- Google AI was giving 404 errors
- You already pay for ChatGPT anyway
- ChatGPT should work immediately

---

## Your Options

### Option 1: Stick with ChatGPT (Current)
- ✅ Already set up
- ✅ You pay for it anyway
- ✅ Should work now (once you fix the variable name typo)

### Option 2: Go Back to Google AI
- Add payment method to Google Cloud
- Set up `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY` properly
- Free tier available (but requires payment method)

---

## Recommendation

**Stick with ChatGPT** since:
- You already pay for it
- It's already configured
- No payment method setup needed
- Should work once variable name is fixed

**But if you want Google AI:**
- Add payment method to Google Cloud Console
- We can switch back
- It's free (but needs payment method on file)

---

**Your call!** ChatGPT is ready to go once the variable name is fixed.
