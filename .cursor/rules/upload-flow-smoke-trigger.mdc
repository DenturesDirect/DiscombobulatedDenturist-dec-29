# Upload Flow Smoke-Test Trigger

When editing any file matched by this rule, run a focused browser smoke test before commit/push.

## Required Browser Smoke Test

1. Start app and open localhost.
2. Login with a valid staff/admin account.
3. Open a patient chart.
4. Validate document upload in `Photos and documents`.
5. Validate image upload in `Radiograph / CBCT Scan Analysis`.

## Required Output

Report PASS/FAIL for:

- `Login`
- `Document upload`
- `Radiograph/CBCT upload`
- `Blocking errors introduced`

If upload fails because storage credentials are missing, mark:

- `Code path`: PASS (if request/handler flow works)
- `Environment`: FAIL (missing config)
