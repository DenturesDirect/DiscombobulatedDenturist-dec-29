## What PowerShell Looks Like

When you open it, you'll see:
- A window with a dark background (usually black or blue)
- Text that looks like: `PS C:\Users\info>`
- A blinking cursor where you can type

## Quick Test

Once PowerShell is open, try typing:
```powershell
cd DentureFlowPro
```

Then press Enter. If it works, you're ready to go!

## Alternative: Use VS Code Terminal

If you're using VS Code (the code editor):
1. **Open VS Code**
2. **Press:** `Ctrl + ~` (Ctrl + tilde key)
3. This opens a terminal at the bottom
4. It's already PowerShell!

## Still Confused?

**Just tell me:**
- Are you using VS Code or another code editor?
- Or do you want to use the regular Windows PowerShell?

I can guide you through either one! 😊
