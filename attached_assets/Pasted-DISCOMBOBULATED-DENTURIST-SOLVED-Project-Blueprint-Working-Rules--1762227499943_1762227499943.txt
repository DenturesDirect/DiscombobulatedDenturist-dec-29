DISCOMBOBULATED DENTURIST: SOLVED
Project Blueprint & Working Rules
---------------------------------

PURPOSE
To give Damien a minimal-prompt, clinician-driven workspace for tracking patient treatment from consult through delivery and follow-up.
No unnecessary automation. No intrusive prompts. Each patient exists as one continuous record.

STRUCTURE
Each patient = one document titled:
YYYY-MM-DD — Patient Name

Inside that document:

🚨 ALERT (optional)
Only add if there’s a significant medical or procedural alert.
Example: "Latex allergy — avoid epinephrine."

🩺 CONSULTATION NOTES
Dictate freely. The GPT formats in DOMx style if asked.
No required structure; you control the flow.

🧠 SHADE / LAB
Record manually when mentioned. GPT never prompts unless you ask.

🗓 ONGOING UPDATES
Add dated sections for Try-In, Re-Try, Delivery, Follow-Up, etc.
All new entries append chronologically under the previous note.

WORKFLOW RULES

1. You talk → it writes.
   Use trigger words only when needed: Dictate:, Summarize:, Write referral:, Next step:
2. No autopilots.
   GPT does not prompt for missing info, next steps, or reminders unless you explicitly request it.
3. No forced med history.
   Health info appears only if you add an ALERT manually.
4. Edit anything anytime.
   Sections are fully open — add, delete, or rename as you see fit.
5. All entries remain intact.
   Nothing overwrites; everything stacks in order by date.
6. Export / backup regularly.
   Project data lives inside ChatGPT until exported.
   Google Drive or local SSD backups will be scripted later.

MEMORY POLICY
During Blueprint Phase:

* Memory OFF (no outside memory).
* Everything stays self-contained within the project's documents.
* The system does not recall details from other chats or GPTs.

Later (Automation Phase):

* Enable memory inside a custom GPT.
* It will then remember patient identifiers, labs, shades, CDCP follow-up rules, and writing style — still without prompting unless told.

HOW TO USE

1. Open Project → "Discombobulated Denturist: SOLVED."
2. Click "+ → Document."
3. Name it YYYY-MM-DD — Patient Name.
4. Begin with your consult:
   Dictate: Initial consult for [Patient Name]...
5. Keep adding dated updates as the case progresses.
6. Export or back up whenever desired.

FUTURE EXPANSIONS (when ready)

* Automatic timestamps.
* DDS referral generation on command.
* CDCP submission reminders.
* Patient-list registry view (date-sortable).
* Memory integration once workflow finalized.
