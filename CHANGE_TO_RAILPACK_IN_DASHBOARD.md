# 🔧 Change to Railpack in Railway Dashboard

## The Problem

**Railway Settings still shows "Nixpacks. Deprecated"** - you need to change it manually in the dashboard.

---

## Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Go to Settings

1. **Railway → web service → Settings tab**
2. **Scroll to "Build" section**

### Step 2: Change Builder

1. **Find "Builder" or "Build method" dropdown**
2. **It probably says "Nixpacks" or "Nixpacks (Deprecated)"**
3. **Click the dropdown**
4. **Select "Railpack"** (or whatever the new option is)
5. **Save**

## If You Don't See "Railpack" Option

**Check what options are available:**
- Railpack?
- Dockerfile?
- Auto-detect?
- Something else?

**Tell me what options you see and I'll help you pick the right one!**

---

## After Changing

1. **Save the settings**
2. **Railway will rebuild automatically**
3. **Should work now!**

---

**Go to Railway Settings → Build → Change from "Nixpacks" to "Railpack" (or whatever the new option is)!**
